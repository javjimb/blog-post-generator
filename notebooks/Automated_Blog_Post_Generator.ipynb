       "      <td>Home » Dog beach in Denia The coast of Dénia is one of the main attractions of the city. However, it is not always accessible to everyone. Pets, in fact, are not usually welcome at the seashore. There is only one dog-friendly beach in the city, located on the northern breakwater of the harbour. However, depending on the time of year, you can also enjoy the rest of the coastline with your four-legged companions. In Dénia there has always been a growing sector of the population that has demanded spaces to enjoy the coast in summer with their pets. In fact, for some years now there has been a beach that admits dogs during the twelve months of the year, but it is a very limited corner that lacks the services and care of the rest of the beaches. However, for a large part of the year, dogs are allowed on almost the entire coastline of Dianes. This is always outside the high summer season, so that sun and beach tourism does not benefit from this measure, which could serve as an attraction for families with pets. As we were saying, there is a small corner of the beach where dogs are allowed. Here, known as the dog beach, people and dogs coexist to enjoy the sand and a good swim away from the prohibitions. It is a sandy beach formed by several breakwaters, so the presence of vegetation such as posidonia is common. It is no more than 100 metres long, so users have little space to enjoy it. It is located on the north breakwater of the port, between the Punta del Raset beach and the Baleària station. It is easily accessible from the town centre, as it is only a short distance from it, so it is not necessary to take the car. In fact, it is advisable to walk there as there is no public parking space nearby. Although the aforementioned beach is the only one considered dog-friendly, the truth is that most of the beaches in Dénia allow dogs outside the high and medium summer season. Dogs are allowed on almost all of Dénia’s natural beaches from 1st November to 1st March. In the case of the urban beaches of Marineta Cassiana and a stretch of Les Marines, access with pets is allowed until the 1st of June. However, there are some exceptions. Both at the end of Les Deveses and in the area of l’Alberca, on Els Molins beach, the presence of dogs is completely forbidden all year round. In addition, there are marked out restricted areas that may not be walked on. These are the regenerating dunes, which are also breeding grounds for the kentish plover, a protected native species.

       "1  Home » Dog beach in Denia The coast of Dénia is one of the main attractions of the city. However, it is not always accessible to everyone. Pets, in fact, are not usually welcome at the seashore. There is only one dog-friendly beach in the city, located on the northern breakwater of the harbour. However, depending on the time of year, you can also enjoy the rest of the coastline with your four-legged companions. In Dénia there has always been a growing sector of the population that has demanded spaces to enjoy the coast in summer with their pets. In fact, for some years now there has been a beach that admits dogs during the twelve months of the year, but it is a very limited corner that lacks the services and care of the rest of the beaches. However, for a large part of the year, dogs are allowed on almost the entire coastline of Dianes. This is always outside the high summer season, so that sun and beach tourism does not benefit from this measure, which could serve as an attraction for families with pets. As we were saying, there is a small corner of the beach where dogs are allowed. Here, known as the dog beach, people and dogs coexist to enjoy the sand and a good swim away from the prohibitions. It is a sandy beach formed by several breakwaters, so the presence of vegetation such as posidonia is common. It is no more than 100 metres long, so users have little space to enjoy it. It is located on the north breakwater of the port, between the Punta del Raset beach and the Baleària station. It is easily accessible from the town centre, as it is only a short distance from it, so it is not necessary to take the car. In fact, it is advisable to walk there as there is no public parking space nearby. Although the aforementioned beach is the only one considered dog-friendly, the truth is that most of the beaches in Dénia allow dogs outside the high and medium summer season. Dogs are allowed on almost all of Dénia’s natural beaches from 1st November to 1st March. In the case of the urban beaches of Marineta Cassiana and a stretch of Les Marines, access with pets is allowed until the 1st of June. However, there are some exceptions. Both at the end of Les Deveses and in the area of l’Alberca, on Els Molins beach, the presence of dogs is completely forbidden all year round. In addition, there are marked out restricted areas that may not be walked on. These are the regenerating dunes, which are also breeding grounds for the kentish plover, a protected native species.

       "1  home  dog beach in denia the coast of dnia is one of the main attractions of the city however it is not always accessible to everyone pets in fact are not usually welcome at the seashore there is only one dogfriendly beach in the city located on the northern breakwater of the harbour however depending on the time of year you can also enjoy the rest of the coastline with your fourlegged companions in dnia there has always been a growing sector of the population that has demanded spaces to enjoy the coast in summer with their pets in fact for some years now there has been a beach that admits dogs during the twelve months of the year but it is a very limited corner that lacks the services and care of the rest of the beaches however for a large part of the year dogs are allowed on almost the entire coastline of dianes this is always outside the high summer season so that sun and beach tourism does not benefit from this measure which could serve as an attraction for families with pets as we were saying there is a small corner of the beach where dogs are allowed here known as the dog beach people and dogs coexist to enjoy the sand and a good swim away from the prohibitions it is a sandy beach formed by several breakwaters so the presence of vegetation such as posidonia is common it is no more than 100 metres long so users have little space to enjoy it it is located on the north breakwater of the port between the punta del raset beach and the baleria station it is easily accessible from the town centre as it is only a short distance from it so it is not necessary to take the car in fact it is advisable to walk there as there is no public parking space nearby although the aforementioned beach is the only one considered dogfriendly the truth is that most of the beaches in dnia allow dogs outside the high and medium summer season dogs are allowed on almost all of dnias natural beaches from 1st november to 1st march in the case of the urban beaches of marineta cassiana and a stretch of les marines access with pets is allowed until the 1st of june however there are some exceptions both at the end of les deveses and in the area of lalberca on els molins beach the presence of dogs is completely forbidden all year round in addition there are marked out restricted areas that may not be walked on these are the regenerating dunes which are also breeding grounds for the kentish plover a protected native species calle sant roc 12 03779 els poblets alicante spaintel 0034 670 03 06 02  0034 965 03 80 72email infohappyinthesuncomweb wwwhappyinthesuncom n registro turstico egtv  879  a   developed by  net2rent   2023 relax in the sun sl  "
